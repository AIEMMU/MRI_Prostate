# Automatic Prostate segmentation from MR images
This provides some deep Learning code for training a deep learning model for segmentation from Magnetic Resonance(MR) Images. There is also a pyqt software avaialble to allow users to explore the use of the deep learning model that was trained as part of this project. 

## Dependencies
Before running the python software, you need install its dependecies, which relies on Pytorch, FastAi, and PyDicom.You can install the dependences from the command line using the following command: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
